📚 I am a professional in Advertising and Marketing with experience in managing manufacturing and service businesses. My interest in digital transformation has allowed me to acquire and apply hard skills such as Databases, Business Analytics, Data Visualization and Storytelling, Adobe Creative Suite, Tableau, SQL, AppSheet, Power BI, and Power Apps.

🚛📈 Currently, I am working for Stoughton Trailers in the Continuous Improvement area, where I’ve found significant opportunities to develop solutions ranging from spreadsheets with dashboards to monitor quality metrics, to the creation of AppSheet applications for collecting production line data and integrating it with Power BI dashboards.

🚌 My first major data project involved developing an application in Microsoft Access for a Public Transportation Company. This platform integrated key operations such as Maintenance, Service Operations, Inventory, Cash Management, and General Management. It provided easy access to all stakeholders through reports and data visualizations.

A few facts about me:
🏎 Formula 1 Fan: I'm a huge fan of Formula 1 and love watching every session of a race weekend. I’m excited to attend another Grand Prix soon!

📻 Old-School at Heart: I enjoy listening to sports radio shows and magazines, though these days I catch them as podcasts.

🎯 Goal for 2025: My main goal for 2025 is to land my dream job in the field of Data.

🚴🏽‍♂️ Cycling Enthusiast: I can’t wait for winter to end so I can get back on the road and hit the bike again!
